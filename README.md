# Objective

The  weighted parametric group sequential design (WPGSD)  allows one to take advantage of the known correlation structure in constructing efficacy bounds to control family-wise error rate (FWER) for a group sequential design. Here correlation may be due to common observations in nested populations, due to common observations in overlapping populations, or due to common observations in the control arm.
