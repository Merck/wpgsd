Description: Adjusted inference for weighted parametric group sequential design.
  Weighted parametric group sequential design (WPGSD) by Anderson et al. (2022)
  <doi:10.1002/bimj.202100085> allows one to take advantage of the known
  correlation structure in constructing efficacy bounds to control
  family-wise error rate (FWER) for a group sequential design.
  Here, correlation may be due to common observations in nested populations,
  due to common observations in overlapping populations, or due to common
  observations in the control arm.
